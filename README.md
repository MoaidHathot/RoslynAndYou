# RoslynAndYou
Demos and slides for Roslyn and language feature presentation.

The sample solutions currently require Visual Studio 2015 CTP 5 and the Roslyn SDK. As the .Net Compiler Platform continues to evolve and new updates to Visual Studio ship, these samples may need to be updated to match the changes that come with those versions. I make no promise of keeping the demos up to day and besides, you often learn more by trying to fix bugs than just looking at functioning code anyway.
